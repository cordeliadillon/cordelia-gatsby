Some React code samples of four accessible drag-and-drop interaction patterns that can be performed via mouse, keyboard, and screen reader. I put together these examples to accompany Jesse Hausler's [4 Major Patterns for Accessible Drag and Drop](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/4-major-patterns-for-accessible-drag-and-drop-1d43f64ebf09) article in the Salesforce UX blog. [Try out the demo](https://salesforce-ux.github.io/dnd-a11y-patterns/) or [browse the source code](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/dnd-a11y-patterns).
