**a11ies.info** is a tool [Lee White](https://www.shleewhite.com/) and I built to help you create and curate transcripts for useful resources that happen to be shared across the internet as images of text. The goal of **a11ies.info** is to make these resources more accessible to a wider audiences. This is work in progress, so please give it a try and reach out with any feedback!
