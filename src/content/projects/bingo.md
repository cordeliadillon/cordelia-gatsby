**Bingo Buddies** is an interactive, accessible bingo web app. It started as a small side project to learn Firebase and have some fun with a few work friends during meetings. It somehow took off and is now used by larger teams at my company to add some more whimsy to all-hands meetings. Check out my [24 Accessibility article](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/building-an-accessible-bingo-web-app/) about how I built it or jump right into the [source code](https://github.com/cordeliadillon/bingo/).
