Anyone who knows me well knows I love photo booths. In February 2014, my friend [Zach Grosser](https://zachgrosser.com/) and I embarked on a mission to visit as many San Francisco photo booths as we could in just one day. We managed to visit 30 photo booths in 11 hours. Let us know if you'd like suggestions!
