**13 Letters** is a podcast by [Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com/) that I am lucky enough to co-host with [Will Butler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-butler-29132665). On the show, we interview the world's leading accessibility minds, talking about what they do and why they do it. Transcripts are available on [every episode's webpage](https://www.bemyeyes.com/podcasts-show/13-letters).
