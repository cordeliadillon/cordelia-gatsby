In my role as Principal Accessibility Engineer at Salesforce, I advised teams on designing and building products with accessibility in mind. I was particularly passionate about making Service Cloud products accessible for all. You can check out some features I've contributed to in this [Salesforce Service Cloud screen reader demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXRrm_PCG4A).
