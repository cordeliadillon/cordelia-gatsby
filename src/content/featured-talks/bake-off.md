Probably the most fun I've ever had putting together a talk, "The Great Accessibility Bake Off" is structured like an episode of "The Great British Bake Off/Baking Show," with three key challenges: Signature, Technical, and Showstopper. I've had the pleasure of presenting versions of this talk three times in Australia, and would love the opportunity to present it again.
