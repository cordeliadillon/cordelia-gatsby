The 2017 [Funka Accessibility Days](https://www.funka.com/en/we-offer/funka-accessibility-days/) conference in Stockholm was my first international conference, and it absolutely blew me away. A bilingual event, it featured talks in both English and Swedish, with live audio translations, captioning, and sign interpretation in multiple sign languages. Not knowing *any* Swedish, I could walk into a Swedish language session, tune my headset to the English channel, adjust the volume to my liking, and easily follow along. Kudos to the event organizers for running such a seamless and inclusive event.
