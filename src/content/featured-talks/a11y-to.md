In 2019, I got to co-host my favorite North American accessibility conference, [#a11yTO Conf](https://conf.a11yto.com/), with my favorite cactus-shirt-wearing accessibility pal, [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design/). It was super fun to spend two days introducing [all of the amazing speakers](https://conf.a11yto.com/2019/playlist) and making up really bad jokes on the spot with Eric. I'm still amazed no one threw tomatoes at us.
