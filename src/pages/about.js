    <h2 className="f2">Hey there! I'm Cordelia!</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy circumambulating cities, collecting food-shaped novelty hats,
      and trying to keep my houseplants happy. My pronouns are she, her, and hers.

          I hold an {' '}
          <a href="https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/comics">MFA in Comics</a>{' '}
          from California College of the Arts. These days, I mostly draw autobio webcomics
          and have dreams of someday publishing a longer comic memoir about anxiety, OCD,
          and depression. I also love to illustrate slides 
          for my <Link to="/talks">public speaking engagements</Link>.  I'm super excited about
          comics that are accessible to blind and low vision readers.
          If that's your jam, let's talk!

        <p>
          I'm passionate about making technology a
          great experience for <em>everyone</em> and currently work as

          complete an <a href="https://gero.usc.edu/what-is-gerontology/">MA 
          in Gerontology</a> at USC. My professional 
          interests include web accessibility, inclusive design,
