      Hey there! I'm Cordelia McGee-Tubb (though my online handle is
      cordeliadillon in most places). I enjoy circumambulating cities,
      collecting food-shaped novelty hats, and trying to keep my
      houseplants happy. My pronouns are she, her, and hers.

          I hold an {' '}
          <a href="https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/comics">
            MFA in Comics
          </a>{' '} from California College of the Arts.
          These days, I mostly draw autobio webcomics
          and have dreams of someday publishing a longer comic memoir
          about anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression. 
          I also love to illustrate slides for my <Link to="/talks">public speaking engagements</Link>.
          I'm super excited about comics for readers with print disabilities.
          If you're excited about that, too, let's talk!
